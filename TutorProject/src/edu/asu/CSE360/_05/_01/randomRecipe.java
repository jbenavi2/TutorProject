				"Prepare Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Toss the cherry tomatoes in 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper on one half of a roasting pan (leaving the other half empty for the chicken) and transfer to the oven for 15-20 minutes. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Thinly slice the cucumber.\r\n" + 
				"Bread the Chicken: In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs with the honey, dijon mustard, cayenne powder, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. In another shallow bowl, combine the panko with just a touch of salt and pepper. Dip the chicken breasts into the egg mixture, shaking off the excess, and then into the panko, pressing the panko into the chicken to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a plate.\r\n" + 
				"Fry the Chicken: In a large skillet, heat the 1/4 cup of oil over medium high until very hot and almost smoking. Add the chicken, cooking in batches if necessary to avoid over-crowding the skillet, and cook for 3-5 minutes per side until well browned all over. Reduce the heat in the oven to 200ºF and transfer the breasts to the other half of the roasting pan to keep warm.\r\n" + 
				"Prepare the Salad: In a medium bowl, combine the juice of the lemon along with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and whisk until smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of sugar if desired. Toss the arugula and sliced cucumber in the dressing. Tear the basil leaves and gently toss them with the arugula and cucumber. Set aside\r\n" + 
				"To Serve: Divide the dressed salad between plates and arrange a few roasted tomatoes on top along with the shaved parmesan. Serve with the crispy chicken breasts on the side. Enjoy!";
